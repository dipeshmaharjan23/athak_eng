                        them. However, the story of Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj will leave you speechless and confident at
                        the same time if you would listen to his struggles yet the success of his life. So here's to his hard
                        work and determination.
                        Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj(aka Athak) (born on 1971-08-28 (2028-05-12 BS) is a politician

                    <h3 className={styles.heading}>Personal Life and Family</h3>
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Maheshwar was born in a low-caste family (Vishwakarma), and at a very young age, he
                        acknowledged that. He understood what it is like to be a lower caste person with poor family
                        background. Not only has he seen people mistreat his family due to poor financial conditions, but
                        he also has been a victim of caste discrimination in the worst way possible. Maheshwar has six
                        siblings where 5 of them are his brothers, and he is blessed with a single sister whom they love the
                        most. Currently, his parents are living with the youngest brother in Nepalgunj, Banke; however,
                        he is settled in Kohalpur municipality.
                        A simple person with a great mindset, Maheswor loved sports like football and the relay race, and
                        Messi is his favorite player. However, he is widely fond of books and has a library at home.
                        Although keeping up with the latest trends is tough, he still enjoys poetry and reading books.
                        The name of Maheshwar's father is "Sukiram Biswakrma," and his mother is "Rati
                        Biswakarma." Married to "Parbati Pun (Usha)-a whipper of Lumbini province from the moist
                        party as well as a central member; it was an intercaste love marriage where both met while actively
                        working during the Nepalese civil war. The couple was blessed with a boy, "Time Alam," and a
                        girl, "Ahuti Azad."
                        Maheshwar is from a family of farmers, very poor. Still, with hard work, he completed his
                        intermediate-level study in Arts and has a great vision of agriculture, business, politics,
                        organization, and social mobilization. Maheshwar was born in Rukum; however, his life and
                        political career revolved around Kohalpur municipality, Banke.
                        He has always been a nation lover right from the beginning and wanted the caste system to be
                        abolished from society as he had seen enough of it and hated every moment. For him, the "caste
                        system, the untouchability, differences with women, and the inhumane behavior high profile
                        people did with the lower ones calling them "Pakhe" (illiterate) were the worst practices to be
                        revolving in the society, and he wanted it all to be gone permanently. He had political awareness
                        in his mind when he was in grade 5, and right from the beginning, he wanted to be the change
                        everyone wanted to see in society.</p>

                    <h3 className={styles.heading}>How His Political Journey Started?</h3>
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Maheswar heard a radio telecast of "Padma Ratna Tuladhar" in 2043 BS, who stood as a Popular
                        candidate in the General Election and was talking about how unmanaged the Panchayat system is.Through that, Maheshwar was inspired and thought of being a change one day for society and the
                        country itself. However, his journey is complicated.
                        Somedays, he wanted to become a saint and leave all the world's goodness. On all other days, he
                        became an atheist. Moreover, he wanted to be a great lawyer. However, god has other plans for
                        him, and I guess that fits him in the best way possible.
                        As Maheswar grew older, his determination to make a caste discrimination-free society became
                        stronger, but he knew being a Dalit(lower caste person) was not an easy job. Also, he used to see
                        the political activities that happened in the school and actively participated in them. Moreover,
                        Maheswor would write about his thoughts in different programs through which people used to
                        recognize him. Additionally, he was always active in helping people through the Junior Red Cross
                        Society, but he was still an unorganized member and was working independently. However, his
                        political journey started in 2045 when he was first elected as secretary of ANNFSU(during the
                        party formation in Birendra Madhyamik Vidyalaya).</p>

                        Maheshwar always knew what he wanted in life. For him, his thoughts were clear and simple. All
                        he wanted was to be there for the nation, which is why he never was scared to even sacrifice his
                        life during the civil war. It was his instinct to serve the good, and good will come to you that
                        nothing happened and his journey from a Dalit to Minister is amazing. He always thought of

                        way.
                        A great political leader thinks in the most optimistic ways and works for it, and Gahatraj is no
                        different. He knows what this country needs to be the best among all and has better plans to work
                        towards it. Unlike all the politicians who have proved that politics is a dirty game, Gahatraj is one
                        amazing inspiration that youth can admire. He has a farsighted thinking capability to chase his
                        dreams, turn them into reality and provide a better place for all his people to live in.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        As our Nepali says, "Hune biruwa ko chillo paat," which means "good plants show better leaves
                        from the beginning." Athak was not only a hard-working person but also a good debater and had
                        always dreamed of becoming an activist since the start of his life. He has seen the struggle for
                        survival, the death of his family members, and how the world looks at these people, and that is
                        why he wants to be different from everybody else.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className={styles.heading}>
                        How he Got the Name-Athak?
                    </h3>
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Maheshwar, as stated above, really loved working for the people and always loved how he used to
                        work. So when the time came, the party members gave him a nickname-Athak( the person who
                        never gets tired), and that's how it all started. Since then, he has been Athak to work for the
                        betterment of his people.
                        He loves how he got his nickname and is still known by it in his district and everywhere he has
                        served. His nickname is what he earned as a politician, and he hates when people call him
                        Maheswor rather than Athak, which is amazingly beautiful. How could someone be so loved?
                        His journey from a small village to representing a well-developed city with lots of struggle is real
                        and inspirative for every youth who wants to join politics and bring change.

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>

                        Steve Jobs is one of the international personalities he has been most inspired by. He always looks
                        up to his success from nothing to everything, yet a positive attitude towards his life amazes him
                        the most and allows him to be the best at what he does.
                        His message to the Youths
                        Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj believes that youths are the future and the nation's pillars, so they should
                        never get depressed. He warns the youths to be mentally prepared for everything that life is coming
                        to take from them, and at the same time, he aware them to be alert but never scared enough to
                        process their visions.
                        He knows that this country has enough to serve them all, but for that, we all need long-lasting trust,
                        a great sense of hard work, and an act of courage to start from the smallest anyone can wish for.
                        For him, thinking big is the way to success. He strongly believes that inspiration comes from
                        smaller things, but people must understand how it works and should start from somewhere to be
                        somewhere rather than complaining.

                        Maheshwar Jung Gahatraj believes that action speaks louder than words and tries his best to prove
                        that. He firmly believes that the awards are merely for names. We can forever cherish the love
                        people would give them at times for their work. He is more like a blessing kind of person and
                        thinks there is still a long way to go because nothing is permanent in the position. He thinks his
